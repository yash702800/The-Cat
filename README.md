# The Cat – Non-monetary UTXO Cleanup

This repository contains the working draft of a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal
(BIP) tentatively titled **“Non-monetary UTXO Cleanup (The Cat)”**.

It documents a soft-fork consensus change and new standardness rules intended to
remove existing non-monetary UTXOs (NMUs) created by protocols such as Ordinals
and Stamps, and to prevent similar UTXOs from being relayed or mined in the future.

Rather than restricting new transactions directly, The Cat aims to remove demand
for such activity by eliminating the financial incentives for creating NMUs in
the first place.

- Additional notes, scripts, and data may be added over time.

This repository serves as the public discussion link referenced in the BIP header
and in any future pull request to the `bitcoin/bips` repository.

## Process note: mailing list moderation

The usual first step for a BIP is to circulate a detailed proposal on the
Bitcoin Development Mailing List and gather on-list technical feedback before
requesting a BIP number.

In December 2025, multiple attempts were made to post The Cat to the mailing list. These
messages were blocked by moderation and did not appear on the list, preventing
any on-list discussion of the proposal despite it being a fully worked draft.

In the author’s view, this sets a troubling precedent. Moderation should
primarily filter spam and clearly low-effort or off-topic content, not decide
which substantive technical proposals the wider community is allowed to see.
When controversial ideas are stopped at the moderation layer, it effectively
puts a thumb on the scale of Bitcoin’s governance by suppressing discussion
rather than allowing the community to evaluate and critique the ideas on their
technical merits.

Because of this, this repository is being used as the primary venue for public
review and commentary on The Cat. Feedback—supportive or critical—is welcome
here via issues, pull requests, or external discussion that links back to this
draft.
